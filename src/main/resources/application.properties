# This first value can be tried as alternative solution for testing the exception handling mechanism - to return a JSON representation of the given exception
#ticketRepositoryLocation = ticket_registry.txt
# This second value will need to be adopted for the usage of the application - use the full file path for avoiding problems during the FileReader/FileWriter approaches
# Also do not forget to change the location of this input file accordingly to the checkout folder of your project copy - and before running, ensure that you have all the
# required user permissions for accessing the given file
# For stating the path of the given file, use either "\\" or "/" - but of course avoid mixing both in order to overcome any confusions
#ticketRepositoryLocation = C:\\Users\\ferenc.toth\\Desktop\\personal_presentation\\ticket_registry.txt
# On the above location, in spite of the file being available, the absence of user permissions will prevent the program from using it - in the context of the current operating system of coursegit add
ticketRepositoryLocation = C:\\presentation_input\\ticket_registry.txt
# This is a possible location where our program will have access on the current operating system
